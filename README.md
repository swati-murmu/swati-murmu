Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I am Swati, and welcome to my GitHub! 
I am a recent graduate from California State University Fullerton in Business analytics and have previously worked as a Data Analyst for Accenture. 

I am fluent in several data management systems and software, including Excel, Microsoft SQL Server, R, Python, and data visualization tools like Tableau. 
In my last role as a Data Analyst for Accenture, I was responsible for creating visualizations on 800,000+ customersâ€™ data on outages in an area, estimated response time to close an outage to stakeholders using Tableau. This gave me experience in being technically adept and communicating technical terms to a non-technical audience. I also developed 40+ test scripts and cases for the entire team to be used for user acceptance testing. 

Throughout graduate school, I learned more about ETL, data warehousing concepts, and statistical analytical models. I am currently also pursuing certification for AWS Cloud Practitioner. 
I find data exciting and believe that there is a certain art in converting numbers into insights. 

I am also open to full-time roles in data science.
